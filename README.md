LiveSplit.MemoryGraph
=====================
Shows a value of a game's memory in a graph. Probably buggy as hell atm.

Manual Installation
-------------------
Download "Components/LiveSplit.MemoryGraph.dll" and place it into the subdirectory "Components" of your LiveSplit folder. You can then add it to your layout (category "Information").

Usage
-----
You need to tell the plugin, where in the memory it can find the value that you want to display. You can find some known memory addresses in the Wiki:

[Known Addresses for some Games](https://github.com/kugelrund/LiveSplit.MemoryGraph/wiki)

If the address for the value that you want to display is not there, you can find it out yourself using for example the free program Cheat Engine.
